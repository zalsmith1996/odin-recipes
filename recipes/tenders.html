    <img src="../images/tenders.jpg" alt="crispy chicken tenders">
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>These chicken tenders are easy to make and take less than 30 minutes. Made using an air fryer, they're perfectly cooked and just the right amount of crispy. Add them to a plate with a few simple sides and you'll have a very filling meal.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/2 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
        <li>8 chicken tenders (about 1 lb)</li>
        <li>freshly chopped parsley to garnish (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey mustard sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat basket with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg in a small bowl. In a separate bowl, stir together panko and oil until loose and crumbly.</li>
        <li>Dip each tender into the egg, allowing excess to drip off. Dip tender into panko mixture and coat completely. Work in batches if needed, and layer tenders in the basket of the air fryer.</li>
